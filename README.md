# QuestionsClassification

This repository contains files and resources for implementing and comparing various approaches to question classification. Below is a detailed description of the files and their purposes:

## File Descriptions

### 1. **QuestionClassification.ipynb**
This Jupyter Notebook serves as the starting point of the project. It includes:
- General preprocessing steps for the data.
- Initial exploration of the dataset and feature extraction.

### 2. **C02-1150.pdf**
This is the foundational paper: **"Learning Question Classifiers"**. It describes:
- The original concepts and methodologies used for question classification.
- The dataset used, along with their insights and results, which provide a basis for this project.

### 3. **Paper Manipulations.ipynb**
This Jupyter Notebook implements the manipulations and techniques presented in the paper. It reproduces key results and methods discussed in the study, with a focus on:
- Feature engineering.
- Classical classification techniques.

### 4. **Deep Learning Approches.ipynb**
This Jupyter Notebook explores various deep learning methods for question classification, including:
- Architectures such as CNN, RNN, and transformers.
- Techniques like word embeddings and fine-tuning pretrained models.

### 5. **Different Classical Machine Learning Approches.ipynb**
This Jupyter Notebook presents several classical machine learning models for question classification, such as:
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
- Random Forests.
- Naive Bayes, etc.
It also compares their performance on the dataset.

### 6. **data/** 
This folder contains the datasets used in the project:
- `train_set5.txt`: The training set for the classification models.
- `test_set.txt`: The test set for evaluating the models.
